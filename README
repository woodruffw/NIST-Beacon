NAME
    NIST::Beacon - A Perl module for querying NIST's randomness beacon.

VERSION
    version 1.001

SYNOPSIS
            use NIST::Beacon;

            my $beacon = NIST::Beacon->new;
            my $record = $beacon->latest_record;

            print "The latest sequence generated by the NIST beacon is: \n";
            print $record->current, "\n";

DESCRIPTION
    NIST::Beacon provides a perl interface to the REST API of the NIST
    randomness beacon <https://beacon.nist.gov/home>.

  Methods
    "latest_record"
                Returns a NIST::Beacon::Record object containing the latest
                record emitted by the NIST beacon. Returns "undef" if a
                network failure occurs.

    "previous_record(timestamp)"
                Returns a NIST::Beacon::Record object containing the record
                emitted immediately prior to the record emitted at
                "timestamp". "timestamp" must be in Unix timestamp format.
                If no timestamp is given, the current time is assumed.
                Returns "undef" if a network failure occurs or no record
                exists.

    "current_record(timestamp)"
                Returns a NIST::Beacon::Record object containing the record
                emitted at "timestamp". "timestamp" must be in Unix
                timestamp format. If no timestamp is given, the current time
                minus one minuted is assumed (to avoid querying a record
                that has not yet been generated). Returns "undef" if a
                network failure occurs or no record exists.

    "next_record(timestamp)"
                Returns a NIST::Beacon::Record object containing the record
                emitted immediately after the record emitted at "timestamp".
                "timestamp" must be in Unix timestamp format. Returns
                "undef" if no timestamp is given or if the timestamp is in
                the future.
